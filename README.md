# POS Billing System

A POS (Point of Sale) billing summary typically refers to a report or document that provides a detailed breakdown of transactions made at a point of sale. It includes information related to items purchased, prices, taxes, discounts, payment methods, and the total amount spent. Here's what a typical POS billing summary might contain:

* Subtotal: The total cost before taxes and discounts.
* Discounts: Any discounts applied to the items or the total bill.
* Taxes: Tax calculation based on applicable rates.
* Total Amount: The final amount after applying discounts and adding taxes.
